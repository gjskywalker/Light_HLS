- ### AutoPhase

  - #### The most significant contribution lies on how to formulate the phase ordering optimization problem in an RL framework

    - A traditional RL framework includes three parts: Environment, Action, Reward and in AutoPhase, they are the following things:
      - Environment: The program and /or the optimization passes applied so far
      - Action: The optimization pass to apply next
      - Reward: The improvement in the circuit performance after applying this pass

  - #### The framework of AutoPhase
