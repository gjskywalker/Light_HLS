# LLVM-16.0-Tutorial

A blog for LLVM(v16.0.0) beginner, step by step, with detailed documents and comments. This blog records the way I learn LLVM and finnaly accomplish a complete project with it. Therefore, I will keep updating this blog according to the progress of my project. Currently, my target is to implement a source code optimizer. I am happy to discuss and any suggestion will be welcome ^_^ (tliang@ust.hk). ~If this blog is useful for you, a STAR will be encouragement to me. LOL~ 

The learner note leads to our project for FPGA HLS, **[Light-HLS](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS)**, presented in ICCAD 2019. If you are interested in analyzing LLVM from the perspective of project, you can have a look at  **[Light-HLS](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Light-HLS)**. Please note that Light-HLS targets at FPGAs.If Light-HLS helps for your works, please cite [our paper in ICCAD 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8942136) ^_^: 

    T. Liang, J. Zhao, L. Feng, S. Sinha and W. Zhang, "Hi-ClockFlow: Multi-Clock Dataflow Automation and Throughput Optimization in High-Level Synthesis," 2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), Westminster, CO, USA, 2019, pp. 1-6. doi: 10.1109/ICCAD45719.2019.8942136


LLVM is very interesting tool but it is also upsetting for beginners (e.g. me). In this blog, I begin with the simplest pass construction and invocation, trying to explain the usage of some functions, types and variables. A complete project will be built gradually. I just hope this github can help some people like me to understand and handle LLVM better.  PS: **Clang** provides user with **Python-APIs**, hence some people may use python to handle/analyze/transform the source code. An example project can be found **[here](https://github.com/zslwyuan/Hi-DMM)**.

Please note that all the experiments are built with **LLVM-11.0.0**.  In this blog, I tend to make the passes standalone, which means that they can be called in a main source code, but do not implement in the way which requires users compile the pass into dynamic library, re-make the LLVM source code and invoke the pass by "opt" command in the terminal. I think it might not be flexible, convenient and portable for development and testing. **Visual Studio Code** is the suggested editor since you can trace the functions and variables in LLVM very easily with VScode.

## [How to use this blog](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials#how-to-use-this-blog)

1. download the blog (entire project) and install LLVM-11.0.0.
2. basic functiones and passes are implemented in the directory **["Implementations"](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials/tree/master/Implementations)**. Nearly all the directories have their own README file to explain the directory.
3. experiments are tested in the directory **["Test"](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials/tree/master/Tests)**.
4. by making a "build" directory and using CMake in each experiment directory (e.g. **[this one](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials/tree/master/Tests/LLVM_exp5_SimpleTimingAnalysis/)**), executable can be generated and tried. (hint: cmake .. & make) 
5. for user's convenience, I prepare some scripts for example, **BuildAllFiles.sh**, which will build all the projects, **CleanBuiltFiles.sh**, which will clean all the built files to shrink the size of the directories, and **Build.sh** in test directory, which will just build one test project. All these scripts can be run directly.
6. looking into the source code with detailed comments, reader can trace the headers and functions to understand how the experiment work.

## [Further development](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials#further-development)

If you want to do your own works based on this project, following hints might be useful.

1. user can add their passes according to the examples in the directory  **["Implementations"](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials/tree/master/Implementations)**. 
2. Note for development: (a) remember to define unique marco for header files (like #ifndef _HI_HI_POLLY_INFO);  (b) Modify the CMakelists.txt file in the 4 directories: **the pass directory([example](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials/tree/master/Implementations/HI_SimpleTimingEvaluation/CMakeLists.txt)), Implementation directory([example](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials/tree/master/Implementations/CMakeLists.txt)), LLVM_Learner_Libs directory([example](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials/tree/master/Tests/LLVM_Learner_Libs/CMakeLists.txt)) and the test directory([example](https://github.com/zslwyuan/LLVM-11-Tutorials/blob/master/Tests/LLVM_exp7_DuplicateInstRemove/CMakeLists.txt))**. The modification should add subdirectory and consider the including path/library name.
