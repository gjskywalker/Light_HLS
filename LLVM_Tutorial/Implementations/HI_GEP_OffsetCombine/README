HI_GEP_OffsetCombine pass is tested by LLVM_expXXXX

The pass will transform those GEP operation with multiple offset operand into the one with single offset

This transformation pass include the following step:

1. find GEP operation
2. extract GEP offset operands
3. do some multiplications and additions to obtain the exact offset, by generating some related instruction
4. generate the GEP with single offset

for example:

int A[50][100]   ->  int A[5000]
A[i][j]    ->   A+i*100+j
