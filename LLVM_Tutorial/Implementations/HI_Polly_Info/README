The Polly_Info pass is mainlyed tested by LLVM_exp4_polly_info

Polly_Info itself do nothing but it shows how to involve the Polly-series Passes in our own pass. Please note that the Passes, which Polly_Info and PollyhedralInfo depend on, should be added in the front in the application (PM.add(XXX))

Detailed explanation can be found in the source code's comments.

Please note that the compilation relies on some parameters and arguments and variable from PollyConfig.cmake,
Please refer to the change in CMakeLists.txt, compared to previous experiment
You can just find the "Polly" in the CMakeLists.txt and notice the modification

In the source code, you need to add all the dependence passes into passmanager otherwise you might get runtime error such as "Pass 'Unnamed pass: implement Pass::getPassName()' is not initialized"
